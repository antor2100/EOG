   This directory is used by IDL to hold the contents of the user
command recall buffer between IDL sessions.

If the IDL_RBUF_PERSIST preference is True, IDL writes the
contents of its command recall buffer to a command history
file here when it exists. Subsequent IDL invocations read the
history file to initialize their buffer.

You may remove any files found here. If you remove a history
file, the next IDL invocation will not find it, and will instead
start with an empty command recall buffer
